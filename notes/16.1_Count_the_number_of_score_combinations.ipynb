    "# Count the Number of Score Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "In an American football game, a play can lead to 2 points (safety), 3 points (field \n",
    "goal), or 7 points (touchdown, assuming the extra point).  Many different \n",
    "combinations of 2, 3, and 7 point plays can make up a final score.  For example,\n",
    "four combinations of plays yield a score of 12:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 safeties ($2\\times 6 - 12$),\n",
    "- 3 safeties, and 2 field goals ($2\\times 3 + 3\\times 2 = 12$),\n",
    "- 1 safety, 1 field goal, and 1 touchdown ($2\\times 1 + 3 \\times 1 + 7\\times 1 = 12$),\n",
    "- 4 field goals ($3\\times 4 = 12$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a program that takes a final score and scores for individual plays, and \n",
    "returns the number of combinations of plays that result in the final score.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can gain some intuition by considering small scores.  For example, a 9 point score\n",
    "can be achieved in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- scoring 7 points, followed by a 2 point play,\n",
    "- scoring 6 points, followed by a 3 point play, and\n",
    "- scoring 2 points, followed by a 7 point play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing, an $s$ spoint score can be achieved by an $s - 2$ point score, followed\n",
    "by a 2 point play, an $s - 3$ point score, followed by a 3 point play, or an $s - 7$\n",
    "point score, followed by a 7 point play.  This gives us a mechanism for recursively\n",
    "enumerating all possible scoring sequences which lead to a given score.  Note that \n",
    "different sequences may lead to the same score combination, eg a 2 point play \n",
    "followed by a 7 point play and a 7 point play followed by a 2 point play both lead\n",
    "to a final score of 9.  A brute-force approach might be to enumerate these sequences,\n",
    "and count the distinct combinations within these sequences, eg by sorting each \n",
    "sequence and inserting into a hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is very high, since there may be a very large number of scoring\n",
    "sequences.  Since all we care about are the combinations, a better approach is to\n",
    "focus on the number of combinations for each possible number of plays of a single\n",
    "type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the final score is 12 and we are ollowed allowed 2 point plays, there \n",
    "is exactly 1 way to get 12.  Now suppose we are allowed both 2 and 3 point plays,\n",
    "Since all we care about are combinations, assume the 2 point plays come before the 3\n",
    "point plays.  We could have zero 2 point plays, for which there is one combination of \n",
    "3 point plays, one two point play, for which there no combinations of 3 point plays\n",
    "(since 3 does not evenly divide 12 - 2, two 2 point plays, for which there no\n",
    "combination of 3 point plays (since 3 evenly divides $12 - 2\\times 3$), three 2\n",
    "point plays, for which there is one combination of 3 point plays (since 3 evenly\n",
    "divides $12 - 2\\times 3$), etc.  To count combinations when we add 7 point plays\n",
    "to the mix, we add the number of combinations of 2 and 3 that lead to 12 and 15 - \n",
    "these are the only scores from which 7 point plays can lead to 12.\n",
    " \n",
    "Naively implemented, for the general case, ie, individual play scores are \n",
    "$W[0], W[1],...,W[i - 1]$, and $s$ the final score, the approach outlined above has\n",
    "exponential complexity because it repeatedly solves the same problems.  We can use\n",
    "DP to reduce its complexity.  Let the 2D array $A[i][j]$ store the number of score\n",
    "combinations that result in a total of $j$, using individual plays of scores\n",
    "$W[0], W[1],...,W[i - 1]$.  For example, $A[1][12]$ is the number of ways in which\n",
    "we can achieve a total of 12 points, using 2 and/or 3 point plays.  Then, \n",
    "$A[i + 1][j]$ is simply $A[i][j]$ (no  $W[i + 1]$ point plays used to get to $j$), \n",
    "plus $A[i][j - W[i - 1]]$ (one $W[i + 1]$ point play), plus $A[i][j - 2W[i + 1]]$\n",
    "(two $W[i + 1]$ point plays), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm directly based on the above discussion consists of three nested loops.\n",
    "The first loop is over the total range of scores, and the second loop is over scores \n",
    "for individual plays.  For a given $i$ and $j$, the third loop iterates over at most \n",
    "$j/W[i] + 1$ values.  (For example, if $j = 10, i = 1, \\text{and } W[i] = 3$, then\n",
    "the third loop examines $A[0][10], A[0][7], A[0][4], A[0][1]$.)  Therefore number\n",
    "of iterations for the third loop is bounded by $s$.  Hence, the overall time \n",
    "complexity is $O(sns) = )(s^2n)$ (first loop is to $n$, second is to $s$, third is\n",
    "bounded by $s$).\n",
    " \n",
    "Looking more carefully at the computation for the row $A[i + 1]$, it becomes\n",
    "apparent that it is not as efficient as it could be.  As an example, suppose we are\n",
    "working 2 and 3 point plays.  Suppose we are done with 2 point plays.  Let $A[0]$ \n",
    "be the row holding the result for just 2 point plays, ie $A[0][j]$ is the number of \n",
    "combinations of 2 point plays that result in a final score of $j$.  The number of\n",
    "score combinations to get a final score of 12 when we include 3 point plays in \n",
    "addition to 2 point plays is $A[0][0] + A[0][3] + A[0][6] + A[0][9] + A[0][12]$.\n",
    "The number of score combinations to get a final score of 15 when we include 3 point\n",
    "plays in addition to 2 point plays is \n",
    "$A[0][0] + A[0][3] + A[0][6] + A[0][9] + A[0][12] + A[0][15]$.  Clearly this\n",
    "repeats computation - $A[0][0] + A[0][3] + A[0][6] + A[0][9] + A[0][12]$ was \n",
    "computed when considering the final score of 12.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that $A[1][15] = A[0][15] + A[1][12]$.  Therefore a better way to fill in \n",
    "$A[1]$ is as follows:  \n",
    "$A[1][0] = A[0][0],A[1][1] = A[0][1],A[1][2] = A[0][2],A[1][3] = $\n",
    "$A[0][3] + A[1][0],A[1][4] = A[0][4] + A[1][1],A[1][5] = A[0][5] + A[1][2], ...$.\n",
    "Observe that $A[1][i]$ takes $O(1)% time to compute - it's just \n",
