    "# The 3-Sum Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design an algorithm that takes as input an array and a number and determines if \n",
    "there are three entries in the array (not necessarily distinct) which adds up to the \n",
    "specified number.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the array is `[11, 2, 5, 7, 3]` then there are \n",
    "three entries in the array which add up to 21 (3, 7, 11, and 5, 5, 11).  (Note that\n",
    "we can use 5 twice, since the problem statement said we can use the same entry more\n",
    "than once.)  However, no three entries add up to 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force algorithm is to consider all possible triples, eg, by three nested\n",
    "for-loops iterating over all entries.  The time complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is\n",
    "the length of the array, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be the input array and $t$ the specified number.  We can improve the time \n",
    "complexity to $O(n^2)$ by storing the array entries in a hash table first.  Then we\n",
    "iterate over pairs of entries, and for each \n",
    "$A[i] + A[j]$ we look for $t - (A[i] + A[j])$ in the hash table.  The space \n",
    "complexity is now $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can avoid the additional space complexity by first sorting the input.  \n",
    "Specifically, sort $A$ and for each $A[i]$, search for indices $j$ and $k$ such that\n",
    "$A[j] + A[k] = t - A[i]$.  We can do each such search in $O(n \\log n)$ time by\n",
    "iterating over $A[j]$ values and doing binary search for $A[k]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve the time complexity to $O(n)$ by starting with $A[0] + A[n - 1]$.\n",
    "If this equals $t - A[i]$, we're done.  Otherwise, if $A[o] + A[n - 1] < t - A[i]$,\n",
    "we move to $A[1] + A[n - 1]$ - there is no chance of $A[0]$ pairing with any other \n",
    "entry to get $t - A[i]$ (since $A[n - 1]$  is the largest value in $A$).  Similarly,\n",
    "if $A[0] + A[n - 1] > t - A[i]$, we  move to $A[1] + A[n - 2]$.  This approach\n",
    "eliminates an entry in each iteration, and spends $O(1)$ time in each iteration, \n",
    " yielding an $O(n)$ time bound to find $A[j]$ and $A[k]$ such that $A[j] + A[k] = t - A[i]$,\n",
    " if such entries exist.  The invariant is that if two elements which sum to the \n",
    " desired value exist, they must lie within the subarray currently under \n",
    " consideration.\n",
    " \n",
    " For the given example, after sorting the array is `[2,3,5,7,11]`.  For entry \n",
    " $A[0] = 2$, to see if there are $A[j]$ and $A[k]$ such that $A[0] + A[j] + A[k] = 21$, \n",
    " we search for two entries that add up to $21 - 2 = 19$."
