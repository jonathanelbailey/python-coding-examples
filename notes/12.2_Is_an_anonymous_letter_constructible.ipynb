    "A brute force approach is to count for each character in the character set the\n",
    "number of times it appears in the letter and in the magazine.  If any character\n",
    "occurs more often in the letter than the magazine we return `False`, otherwise\n",
    "we return `True`.  This approach is potentially slow because it iterates over\n",
    "all characters, including those that do not occur in the letter or magazine.  It\n",
    "also makes multiple passes over both the letter and the magazine - as many passes\n",
    "as there are characters in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach is to make a single pass over the letter, storing the character \n",
    "counts for the letter in a single hash table - keys are characters, and values are\n",
    "the number of times that character appears.  Next, we make a pass over the magazine.\n",
    "When processing a character `c`, if `c` appears in the hash table, we reuce its\n",
    "count by 1; we remove it from the hash when its count goes to zero.  If the hash\n",
    "becomes empty, we return `True`.  If we reach the end of the letter and the hash is\n",
    "nonempty, we return false - each of the characters remaining in the hash occurs more\n",
    "times in the letter than the magazine."
